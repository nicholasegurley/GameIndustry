# Welcome to the Game Industry notes respository! #

## Description ##

This is a running list of notes, thoughts, and resources that I've picked up (and are continuing to pick up) that may be useful for talented, creative people pursuing a career in the entertainment side of the Game Industry.

## Who It Is For ##

This is meant for anyone who is interested in working (or is already working) in the entertainment side of the Game Industry.  I am planning to update this explicitly during the Indie Game Academy Level 3 course.

Please feel free to use and share this information.

## Why GitHub? ##

Doing it on GitHub will allow everyone to be able to copy it and store it in the note-taking / 2nd brain app of their choice.
